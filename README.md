# 💼 My Personal Portfolio Website

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my personal portfolio site — a space where I showcase who I am, the skills I've gained, and the projects I've worked on. I built this using simple HTML and CSS, and it's hosted right here on GitHub Pages.

## 📁 What’s Inside

Here’s a quick look at the main parts of the project:

- **assets/** – All the images, icons, and the CSS stylesheet
- **experience/** – Highlights of my work experience
- **projects/** – Details of the projects I’ve completed
- **index.html** – The homepage that brings it all together

## 🚀 Highlights

- Clean and responsive layout
- Sections for my professional experience and personal projects
- Easy to maintain and update
- Deployed for free using GitHub Pages

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This portfolio was created using:

- HTML5
- CSS3

## ⚙️ Deployment

I’ve automated the deployment using GitHub Actions — so every time I make changes and push to the main branch, the site gets updated automatically.  
You can find the workflow config in: `.github/workflows/static.yml`
